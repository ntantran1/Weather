I used 2 web services for excercise. The 2 services are:

1. https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=&appid=690f2e3cc64b62c1c4d76ec39f9dd7da&units=metric
	-This service is to get the weather information.
2. http://api.zippopotam.us/us/
	-This service is to get area information from the zipcode such as city, state, latitude, longitude.
